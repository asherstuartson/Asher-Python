    "# Summary: This Python code loads a dataset of school information and performs several data analysis tasks. It begins by identifying schools with average math scores exceeding 80% of the maximum possible score. It then calculates the total SAT scores for each school and identifies the top 10 schools with the highest total SAT scores. Finally, the code groups schools by borough and determines the borough with the largest standard deviation in total SAT scores, providing a valuable overview of school performance and regional disparities.\n",
